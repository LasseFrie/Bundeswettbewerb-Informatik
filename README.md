# 🏆 BWINF Contribution: Years 2019 & 2020 🚀

Welcome to my BWINF project contribution! In this project, I've developed solutions for three tasks: Blumenbeet, Stromrallye, and Wörter einsetzen. These tasks were accomplished during my school years. The programming languages used were C# and Python.

The Bundeswettbewerb Informatik (BWINF) is a prestigious German computer science competition that challenges young students to solve complex computational problems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project has two primary languages, C# and Python. You should have the .NET environment and Python interpreter installed on your machine to execute the tasks.

### ⬇️ Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine using git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/bwinf-contribution.git
```

Then, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd bwinf-contribution
```

## 🛠️ Execution

In the project directory, you can find three sub-projects: Blumenbeet, Stromrallye, and Wörter einsetzen. Each of them has separate instructions for execution.

### 💐 Blumenbeet

Navigate to the Blumenbeet directory and execute the C# or Python file.

### 🔌 Stromrallye

The Stromrallye project has an executable which can be run directly from the command line, and a .txt file can be passed as the path for testing.

```bash
cd Stromrallye
./StromrallyeExecutable your_test_file.txt
```

### 📝 Wörter einsetzen

Navigate to the Wörter einsetzen directory and execute the C# or Python file.

#### 🎯 Features
